This embedded systems project was developed as part of a course at my university. My team and I
collaborated to build a smart agriculture system. I was responsible for designing and developing a control
node using the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, capable of switching electrical loads via relays and
MOSFETs. Both the firmware and PCB were custom-built for this purpose.
